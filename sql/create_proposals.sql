        Any player may request permission to invite one or more specifically named persons (each

        24 hours to respond with an affirmative, negative, abstention or veto for each
        Potential Player. Current players not responding to the proposal of a Potential Player
        within 24 hours are determined to have abstained for that Potential Player.
        Permission is granted with a simple majority of "Active Responders" (affirmative responders / total
        non-abstaining responders), and no vetos. Each Player is allowed three lifetime vetos which
        may be used to forbid a new player from joining the game, regardless of the voting results
        from other players. Potential Players who are granted permission to join, and choose to join,
        start with a number of points equal to the lowest non-negative point total of active players,
        and assume their turn position pursuant to Rule 3 as of the conclusion of the turn active at the
        time of their joining. The inviting player ("Sponsor") earns 3 points per new player who joins
        under this rule and makes at least one proposal. The total maximum points over the course of
        the game which may be awarded to a Sponsor under this rule is 15. Players who have their turn
